OVERALL: Progressing

* When a packet is destined for a router in the same subnet, it should be sent only using layer 2 (i.e., should not send to gateway)
* Your code for checking if a packet has already been received assumes it is the exact same instance of the packet and does not check if a packet is a different instance with the same field values
* Costs in routing tables do not reflect proper number of hops distance
* Routing table does not include router's own subnets by default; depending on the sequence of RIP packets, a router may add its own subnet with another router as the next hop, which is also incorrect
* In some topologies an ARP packet is sent for addresses that are never the destination or gateway for any packet
* Client sends ARP reply even when it's IP address is not the destination of the ARP request it received
